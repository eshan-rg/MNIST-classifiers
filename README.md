# MNIST-classifiers
I have implemented 5 different classifiers for the MNIST dataset:
1. Fully Connected Neural Network
2. Simple Convolutional Network
3. AlexNet
4. VGG-16 (using Transfer Learning)
5. ResNet-50

All the jupyter notebooks have the code along with the evaluation. The comparision and analysis of the performance of all these classifiers can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-YZe6tF7hNk4Jwd52aI7V6EZbxJ6-zM9/view?usp=sharing).
