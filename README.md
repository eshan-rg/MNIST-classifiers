# MNIST-classifiers
I have implemented 5 different classifiers for the MNIST dataset:
1. Fully Connected Neural Network
2. Simple Convolutional Network
3. AlexNet
4. VGG-16 (using Transfer Learning)
5. ResNet-50

All the jupyter notebooks have the code along with the evaluation. The evaluation metrics also include a Confusion Matrix.
